Django-Messagegroups
====================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gwrtheyrn/django-messagegroups.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gwrtheyrn/django-messagegroups)

This Django app provides a template tag to render all messages (sent via the Django messaging
framework) and to display them grouped by category.

Since tag v0.2, django-messagegroups is compatible with Bootstrap 1, and since v0.3, it uses
Bootstrap 2 markup.


Install
-------

The best way to install `django-messagegroups` is using pip:

    pip install django-messagegroups

To get the current development version, you can install the version from Github:

    pip install -e git://github.com/gwrtheyrn/django-messagegroups.git#egg=messagegroups

Finally add `messagegroups` to your INSTALLED\_APPS setting.


Usage
-----

    {% load messagegroups %}
    ...
    {% render_messages messages %}


Customize
---------

You can customize the template by overriding the `messagegroups.html` template.

The HTML class markup is compatible with the [Bootstrap CSS Framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (v2).
