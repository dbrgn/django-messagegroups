This Django app provides a template tag to render all messages (sent via the
Django messaging framework) and to display them grouped by category.

Since tag v0.2, django-messagegroups is compatible with Bootstrap 1, and since
v0.3, it uses Bootstrap 2/3 markup.


Install
=======

The best way to install ``django-messagegroups`` is using pip::

    pip install django-messagegroups

To get the current development version, you can install the version from
Github::

    pip install -e git://github.com/dbrgn/django-messagegroups.git#egg=messagegroups

Finally add ``messagegroups`` to your INSTALLED\_APPS setting.


Usage
=====

::

    {% load messagegroups %}
    ...
    {% render_messages messages %}


Customize
=========

You can customize the template by overriding the ``messagegroups.html``
template. Just make sure that your app is in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list
**before** the ``messagegroups`` app.

The HTML class markup is compatible with the `Bootstrap CSS Framework
<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ (2/3).
